Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
"Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."
The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.
"Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay."
We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
"Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there."
You will never win if you never begin.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."
Accept the challenges so that you can feel the exhilaration of victory.
"Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground."
"Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines."
"If you can dream it, you can do it."
"A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others."
"Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds."
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
"If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
"There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self."
"If you fell down yesterday, stand up today."
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
"Quality is not an act, it is a habit."
A somebody was once a nobody who wanted to and did.
"The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence."
"When one must, one can."
"If you're going through hell, keep going."
Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
"Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do."
"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
"Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
Well done is better than well said.
Either you run the day or the day runs you.
I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
"Never, never, never give up."
"The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best."
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
"Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again."
