This is my personal crash course on python 3. I just want to know how to access data,use library, create function, use the for loop,use the ifelse.

Most of this is just google and combine together with my personal creativity skill. feel free to fork my code and improve it.

So what it does?
1. Tell you current date
2. ask city and show temperature
3. load something from csv file and show it to you
4. Open Facebook from python

to test the python code,just type "python main.py" at the cmd/terminal. Make sure change directory to the location fo the source code. eg : "cd /Downloads/learnPython"
